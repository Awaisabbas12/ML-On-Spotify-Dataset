<h1>Objective</h1>
    <p>The goal is to predict whether a song will be popular based on audio features such as danceability, energy, and loudness using classification techniques.</p>

<h1>Modeling</h1>
    <p>Based on popularity, I used classification techniques to predict song popularity. I tried several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, and Gradient Boosting. Among these models, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy at 99% for the Spotify dataset.</p>

<h1>Model Evaluation</h1>
    <p>The target classes were imbalanced, which can lead to bias in machine learning modelsâ€”a common issue known as class imbalance. To address this, I used resampling techniques. After applying resampling, I evaluated the models using metrics such as the confusion matrix and classification report. The Random Forest model continued to perform best after balancing the classes.</p>
